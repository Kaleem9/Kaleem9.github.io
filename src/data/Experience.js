                At DSYH, I was part of the core team building <i>User Interface</i>. My role at DSYH was that of a<strong>UI/UX Developer</strong>. Features required me working across the stack, with HTML5, Css3, JQuery, ReactJS for Front-end.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some features that I worked on here are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Performance improvements to the Post Detail Page. This helped reduce the page load time from 11 seconds to just 4 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked on the rewrite of DSYH.in to React. Specifically focused on UI/UX development on DSYH.in
